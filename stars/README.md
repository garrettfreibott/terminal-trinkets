# Stars

Randomly generates a constantly changing feild of stars in the terminal
in pure ascii! Give it a positive integer, the lower the number, the more
dense the sky will be.

## Usage

`./stars 1000` will give a fairly sparse sky.

`./stars 1` will give a max density sky (just a wall of `#`, quite boring)
Try any other number!
