Run to simulate water droplets accumulating and running down the screen in pure ascii!

You'll probably have to zoom-out (or in) as I hard-coded this to my screen's resolution, lol.
I'll need to fix that at some point.

It will also (eventually) end since the number of droplets is limited to the size of the pthreads array.
I warned you that the code in this repo was pretty rough! It creates a nice effect though, promise.
