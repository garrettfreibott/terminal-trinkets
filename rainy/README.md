# Rainy

Run to simulate water droplets accumulating and running down the screen in pure ascii!

## Usage
just `./rainy`, nothing fancy. If you don't clear out your terminal screen, the drop will
run down your screen and wipe away any text in it's way, it's pretty cool.

It will eventually end since the number of droplets is limited to the size of the pthreads array.
I warned you that the code in this repo was pretty rough! It creates a nice effect though, promise.
